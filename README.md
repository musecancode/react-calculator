# React Calculator 

A basic calculator built using **React** as part of an internship task. It supports operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square root.

##  Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Square root operation
- Real-time result display
-  Clear (`C`) and Backspace (`Del`) buttons
- **Result reusability**: Use result directly in your next input for  `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Allows chained calculations like: 10 - 3 = 7, then 7 + 2 = 9 — without typing 7 again.
